Welcome to molgri's documentation!
==================================

Molgri is a python package assisting you in studying approach vectors and orientations of two interacting
molecules. Some of its main functions include:
 - generating uniform grids on 3- and 4-dimensional spheres (**molgri.space**)
 - generating pseudo-trajectories by positioning molecules at automatically generated distances and orientations (**molgri.molecules**)
 - performing analysis and visualisation of this data (**molgri.plotting**)

The package can be simply used as a command-line program. Users interesting in generating sphere grids,
pseudo-trajoctories or corresponding visualistions are invited to read a quick introduction with many examples
at `our GitHub page <https://github.com/bkellerlab/molecularRotationalGrids>`_
.

Advanced users who may wish to import the package and extend it for their purposes are invited to read the
following API.
