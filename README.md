# molecularRotationalGrids
package to generate relative rotational positions and orientations of two molecular structures

## Installation
[TODO]

## Simple applications: using scripts

For users that simply wish to create rotational grids or psudotrajectories
for their own calculations, we provide scripts with user-friendly, one-line
use. All scripts are provided for you in directory  ðŸ“‚ scripts/

#### Generating rotation grids
Rotation grids can be generated by specifying the number of points and
the generation algorithm (default icosahedron grid). For example, for a
45-point grid generated with a cube 3D algorithm, the command would be

```
python -m scripts.generate_grid -N 45 -a cube3D
```
User can specify additional optional flags to get additional outputs

`--statistics` to get more information about grid properties

`--draw` to save a plot of the grid

`---animate` to save a gif of the plot rotating for 360Â°

`---animate_ordering` to save a gif of the order in which the grid points
are plotted

#### Generating pseudotrajectories



#### Changing default input/output folders
Optionally, if one wishes to change the references to directories where input
(gro files) and output (gro, npy, pdf, gif files) are saved. To do so, run
the command

```
python -m scripts.set_up_io_directories
```

and follow the input commands.
